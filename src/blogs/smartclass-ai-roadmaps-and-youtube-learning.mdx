# SmartClass – AI‑Powered Roadmaps & YouTube Learning for Students

SmartClass helps students turn outcomes (e.g., “learn Full‑Stack”) into **actionable roadmaps**, pairing each step with high‑quality YouTube lectures and practice tasks.

## Project Name and Context

- **Project**: SmartClass (learning assistant)
- **Audience**: Students and self‑learners targeting practical outcomes
- **Why**: Abundance of content, shortage of **structured paths**

## Functionality and Purpose

- **Roadmap generation** from a goal and skill level
- **Curated lectures** with quality filters (duration, engagement, recency)
- **Practice tasks** per node with difficulty ramp
- **Progress tracking** and reminders
- **Offline notes** and flashcards

## Problem It Solves

- Reduces overwhelm; replaces random tutorials with structured tracks
- Finds current, credible videos that actually teach
- Encourages consistency via reminders + visible progress

## Tech Stack Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Backend**: Node.js (API), PostgreSQL (progress), Redis (queues/cache)
- **AI/RAG**: OpenAI/LLM, vector store (pgvector/Weaviate), rerankers
- **Ingestion**: YouTube Data API v3, periodic refresh

## How I Built It (or Am Building It)

### Ingestion & Indexing

```ts
// fetch videos by topic, apply quality filters, store embeddings
for (const topic of topics) {
  const videos = await yt.search(topic, { max: 50 });
  const curated = videos.filter((v) => v.duration < 60 && v.views > 5000);
  await embedAndUpsert(
    curated.map((v) => ({
      id: v.id,
      title: v.title,
      desc: v.description,
    }))
  );
}
```

### Roadmap Synthesis

```ts
// prompt + tools -> DAG of concepts with prerequisites
const roadmap = await llm.plan({ goal: "Full‑Stack Web", level: "beginner" });
// normalize to nodes/edges, attach evaluation rubrics
```

### Retrieval & Ranking

```ts
// hybrid search: dense + lexical + rerank
const candidates = await searchVideos(node.topic);
const reranked = await rerank(candidates, node.learningOutcome);
return pickTop(reranked, 3);
```

### Progress Tracking

```sql
CREATE TABLE progress (
  user_id UUID,
  node_id TEXT,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('todo','doing','done')),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, node_id)
);
```

## Unique Implementations or System Design

- **DAG‑based roadmap** with prerequisite checks
- **Hybrid retrieval** (dense + BM25) then **learning‑outcome rerank**
- **Cold‑start filters**: duration, engagement, recency, channel trust score
- **Practice rubric** to validate completion objectively

## Realistic Challenges or Tradeoffs

- **Ranking drift** if you don’t refresh embeddings and signals
- **YouTube API quotas**; batch and cache aggressively
- **Subjectivity** in “quality” → use explicit signals + user feedback
- **Motivation**: build gentle nudges, not nagging

## What I Learned or Improved

- Treat AI as an orchestrator; keep data models explicit
- Clear UX beats clever prompts—visibility drives completion
- Reliability: background jobs, retries, and observability from day one
